    <p>Tyrannosaurus is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur. The species <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a> (rex meaning "king" in Latin), 
      often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented of these large theropods. 
      Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.</p>
      <p>He could: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>hunt</li>
        <li>bite</li>
        <li>run</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and was a very dangerous animal in general.</p>
